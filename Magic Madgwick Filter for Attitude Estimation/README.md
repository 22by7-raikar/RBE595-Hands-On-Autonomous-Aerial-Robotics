# IMU Attitude Estimation using Madgwick Filter

'Wrapper.py'  contains functions for estimating orientations based on gyroscopic data, accelerometer data, complimentary filter and Madgwick Filter.
Run 
```bash
python Wrapper.py
```
1. To run Madgwick Filter to get the Orientation estimates just open the wrapper.py in the code section of the folder of submission in your desired code compiler. 
2. Run the code to obtain the plots.
3. Uncomment the Last section to visualize the Rotplots.
4. You can change the code file directory to obtain graphs for different instances of train and test sets.
